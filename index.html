		<h1>
			Qualitative Accomplishments
		</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Once I understand something, truly understand it, my ability to use it is increased a hundredfold.
				At the same time, though my memory is sometimes good enough to replicate things, too often things that I don't understand get the better of me.
			</li>
			<li>
				People tend to like me, a great share of the time. Though no one can be liked by all they meet, I come close.
				It often results in people trusting me, which helps both parties when collaboration is involved.
				The downside to this magnetism is that I am sometimes distracting to others, because it is easy to talk about nearly anything.
				Since people feel comfortable around me, the barriers that normally dictate formality are often disregarded in entirety.
			</li>
			<li>
				I'm very logic based. As long as there is an order, some logic inherent in the things I take part in, I've a fighting chance to understand.
				Though, at the same time, it means that true chaos can throw me off my groove.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h1>
			Whole Brain Paragraph
		</h1>
		<p>
			I'm more inclined towards logic than creativity.
			Inspiration comes only when it wants, but perspiration is always within our grasp.
			I've always liked things that can be quantified, more so than that whose value is subjective.
			It is important to remember, though, that both sides are necessary to make the best technology.

	Weekly Reflection
</h1>
<h2>
Week 1
</h2>
<p>
	For my first week, it's been as enjoyable of schooling as I imagine it can be.
	The source material holds such splendid interest for me, and that alone makes this the best class I've ever attended.
	Throw in classmates of such fine temperaments, and another Kenyan, and things could not be better.
	I'm getting pretty decent with html files, though I've the feeling that CSS will be my downfall.
	Javascript seems rather fascinating, so I'll have to look into that when I have the time.
	But that just about wraps up this week's reflection.
	<h2>Week 2</h2>
	My second week has been somewhat harder than the first. PHP has been rather confusing, and I've not yet gotten the hang of it. Once again, I am thankful for my wise, and kind classmates. Whenever I feel lost, I know I can ask them for help, and we'll both be better off for it. This week's greatest challenge has been trying to learn so much knowledge in such a short time. Though it's been difficult, I relish the challenge.
	<h2>Week 3</h2>
	<p>Bootstrap seems to make sense to me on a fundamental level, but it's implementation I still have trouble with. CSS I believe I understand. The capstone that we've done so far I understand. Personas and interaction flow I understand. The board game helped me understand a bit more of my team, and the way they will approach challenges and tasks during our time at the bootcamp.

I like animals. I think that though I understand a solid amount of programming, a job is about far more than mere technical knowledge. I need to make sure I can collaborate with other, and fit in to whatever the way the company works.

<h2>Organizations that interest me</h2>
<h3>For Profit: RS21</h3>
<p>RS21 is an interesting company, at least to me. I saw them initially at the Demo Day just before our class began. They had given a demonstration on disaster preparedness, which seemed both interesting, and useful. They had brought three employees, and each one of them seemed to enjoy their jobs. I decided to go with Brandon Pachuca as my contact. His number is 505-314-2141. I'll try and arrange a visit with them next week.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Non Profit: Tusk</h3>
<p>Tusk focuses on conservation, of protecting and preserving our world. This has always struck a chord with me, because I happen to live on this planet. I'm not yet sure who to contact, but conservation efforts always seem to have a place for good software people, so I'm not terribly worried. Perhaps I'll give them a call sometime next week.
