			Whole Brain Paragraph

		<p>
			I'm more inclined towards logic than creativity.
			Inspiration comes only when it wants, but perspiration is always within our grasp.
			I've always liked things that can be quantified, moreso than that whose value is subjective.
			It is important to remember, though, that both sides are necessary to make the best technology.

	Weekly Reflection
</header>
<p>
	For my first week, it's been as enjoyable of schooling as I imagine it can be.
	The source material holds such splendid interest for me, and that alone makes this the best class I've ever attended.
	Throw in classmates of such fine temperaments, and another Kenyan, and things could not be better.
	i'm getting pretty decent with html files, though I've the feeling that CSS will be my downfall.
	Javascript seems rather fascinating, so I'll have to look into that when I have the time.
	But that just about wraps up this week's reflection
