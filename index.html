			Qualitative Accomplishments
		</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Once I understand something, truly understand it, my ability to use it is increased a hundredfold.
				At the same time, though my memory is sometimes good enough to replicate things, too often things that I don't understand get the better of me.
			</li>
			<li>
				People tend to like me, a great share of the time. Though no one can be liked by all they meet, I come close.
				It often results in people trusting me, which helps both parties when collaboration is involved.
				The downside to this magnetism is that I am sometimes distracting to others, because it is easy to talk about nearly anything.
				Since people feel comfortable around me, the barriers that normally dictate formality are often disregarded in entirety.
			</li>
			<li>
				I'm very logic based. As long as there is an order, some logic inherent in the things I take part in, I've a fighting chance to understand.
				Though, at the same time, it means that true chaos can throw me off my groove.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h1>
			Whole Brain Paragraph
		</h1>
		<p>
			I'm more inclined towards logic than creativity.
			Inspiration comes only when it wants, but perspiration is always within our grasp.
			I've always liked things that can be quantified, more so than that whose value is subjective.
			It is important to remember, though, that both sides are necessary to make the best technology.

	Weekly Reflection
</h1>
<h2>
Week 1
</h2>
<p>
	For my first week, it's been as enjoyable of schooling as I imagine it can be.
	The source material holds such splendid interest for me, and that alone makes this the best class I've ever attended.
	Throw in classmates of such fine temperaments, and another Kenyan, and things could not be better.
	I'm getting pretty decent with html files, though I've the feeling that CSS will be my downfall.
	Javascript seems rather fascinating, so I'll have to look into that when I have the time.
	But that just about wraps up this week's reflection.
	<h2>Week 2</h2>
	My second week has been somewhat harder than the first. PHP has been rather confusing, and I've not yet gotten the hang of it. Once again, I am thankful for my wise, and kind classmates. Whenever I feel lost, I know I can ask them for help, and we'll both be better off for it. This week's greatest challenge has been trying to learn so much knowledge in such a short time. Though it's been difficult, I relish the challenge.
	<h2>Week 3</h2>
	<p>The Forbidden Island. A place shrouded in mystery. We arrived in search of fantastic treasures, having heard tales of the splendor to be found on this foreboding piece of the world. Our group of glory seekers knew we had to work together; only with all four working in tandem could we find this island's Shangri-La. First on our team, the brave adventurer Clayton "Goldheart" Shepard, the man with the instincts of a jungle cat, and the strength of a mountain bear. Then, our messenger Davros Swiftfoot. Never has there been a faster man than Swiftfoot, over any terrain, on any continent. Then, the beautiful diving expert Dr Charlotte Darkwater. She knows no fear, and the only match to her beauty is her stunning intellect. Finally, our engineer Bjornn Hardhammer rounds out the group. Though he's a prickly old man, his technical proficiencies are second to none. The island had become unstable, preparing to sink to the cold ocean floor. Time was of the essence, and in order to find the great four treasures of the verboten land, we needed to find the keys. 4 keys to each lock, and 4 locks to be opened to find our golden payday. I tore mine, the Shining Griffin from the claws of the temple of the Stone Jaguar, atop a great peak. Swiftfoot, agile as a gazelle, ran across falling pillars, vaulting an enormous chasm to snatch the Everburning Jewel from its ancient home. As the island sank, it nearly took him with it, but his impeccable balance and perfect strides kept him just far enough ahead to outstep the catastrophe. Meanwhile, deep below, the beautiful doctor dove deep into the ancient caverns below the island, looking for the Kraken's Goblet. She found it nestled between the teeth of some long dead ancient leviathan, far beyond the territory of man. Even the unshakable heart of this marine expert felt unsettled at the size of the gargantuan beast. Finally, in the mountains of the Abbadon, Hardhammer faced a challenge of his own. In order to capture the Demon's Egg, he had a river of lava to cross, with only stone and rope to build a bridge. Any other man would have quailed at such a task, but our genius engineer felt no fear, merely mild annoyance that none would see this creation. The bridge lasted just long enough to see him safely back before the lava consumed it, melting away any trace that man had conquered it's trap. Racing to Fool's Landing, we four heroes barely reached the pickup point before the very rock below us crumbled into the unforgiving ocean. As the helicopter carried us to safety, I lit up a cigar, and smiled. "It ain't easy being cheesy"

Though I've been having a whale of a time at the bootcamp, in order to become the fat cat I want to be will take effort.
It's a long road to Calvary, but of all the endeavors of my life, this looks to be the greatest.

<h2>Organizations that interest me</h2>
<h3>For Profit: RS21</h3>
<p>RS21 is an interesting company, at least to me. I saw them initially at the Demo Day just before our class began. They had given a demonstration on disaster preparedness, which seemed both interesting, and useful. They had brought three employees, and each one of them seemed to enjoy their jobs. I decided to go with Brandon Pachuca as my contact. His number is 505-314-2141. I'll try and arrange a visit with them next week.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Non Profit: Tusk</h3>
<p>Tusk focuses on conservation, of protecting and preserving our world. This has always struck a chord with me, because I happen to live on this planet. I'm not yet sure who to contact, but conservation efforts always seem to have a place for good software people, so I'm not terribly worried. I'll give them a call sometime next week.
